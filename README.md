# OpenGLShowcase

Showcase of all the examples from [LearnOpenGL](https://www.learnopengl.com) implemented in my own flavor.  

## Compatibility

Minimum Required OpenGL version: **3.3**    
Supports **Windows** & **Linux**.  

## How to build
  
Make sure you have Cmake installed, you can check it by running the following command:  
```  
cmake --version
```  

It should print the version of cmake you have if cmake is installed (minimum required version is 3.6) otherwise install the latest version of cmake.  
Then running this command should build the project in the bin folder.  

```  
cmake -S . -B ./bin
```
